1. The Davison sequence is a sequence of 0s and 1s obtained by starting with 0 and 
successively adding the Boolean complement (negative) of the sequence to its end. 

2. You have a bag containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, with each number appearing
exactly once. However, one of the numbers has been removed from the bag.

3. Finish implementing the program in the Maze/ folder on the Algorithms website. The 
MazeSearcher program reads in a text file representing a maze, such as the following:


The "#"s are the walls of the maze. The "S" marks the start of the maze, and the "E" is 
the exit. In this example, the "S" is located at coordinate (1,0), with x increasing 
across, and y increasing downwards.
